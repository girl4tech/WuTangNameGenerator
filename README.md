# Wu-Tang Clan Name Generator
Whenever I start to layout my program and goal with psuedo code, I like to ask myself 3 questions: the first is - what can the user do, the second is - what can the user see, and the third is - what does the user expect? In this case, this project was a timed challenge and the user is given survey questions that end up randomly generating a name based on the user's responses to the survey questions. To make the activity a bit more fun, the idea was to generate a Wu-Tang Clan name.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This app leveraged the simple use of a form and its inputs, to get user information, evaluate this information and return a random string. This app mainly incorporates a lof of Javascript with minimal HTML / CSS. 

## Optimizations
When I have more time, I'd like to refactor this code to fit ES6+ standards and make it fullstack with node JS.
