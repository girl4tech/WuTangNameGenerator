# Wu-Tang Clan Name Generator
Whenever I start to layout my program and goal with psuedo code, I like to ask myself 3 questions: the first is - what can the user do, the second is - what can the user see, and the third is - what does the user expect? In this case, this project was a timed challenge and the user is given survey questions that end up randomly generating a name based on the user's responses to the survey questions. To make the activity a bit more fun, the idea was to generate a Wu-Tang Clan name.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

It always 
 ES6+ and bonus points for it running on a node server

## Optimizations
When I have more time, I'd like to refactor this code to fit ES6+ standards and make it fullstack using node JS. When I have more time I will go back an adjust the styling to the list to make it look more modern and less retro. I am also planning on making the list full-stack by using Express JS. 

## Lessons Learned:
In completing this project I learned a lot about built-in browser variables liked Local Storage. I also learned more about the client-server model, when reviewing concepts such as the fact that HTTP is stateless, which causes an application to reset the next time it is re-opened. As a developer, I needed to store the state of your interface somewhere. Although this is normally done on the server-side, I didn't want to force people to sign up to use the app. This is one of the main reasons I decided to leverage local storage.
